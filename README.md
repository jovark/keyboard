This is a repository containing all the files and materials used for building my Dactyl Manuform 5x6.

The controllers and other small electronics used for this project were purchased from AliExpress. For everything else here is the parts list:
- [Case and PCBs](https://crystalskeebs.com/)
- [Keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mt3-dancer-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=967474)

Here is a build guide(not by me): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPJl5gswgbQ

*I have now switched to 3D printed DES keycaps. The stl files have been generated with this tool https://github.com/jovark/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles.

*The json file is outdated.
